Pens are created using pen kits bought from Rockler Woodworking.  
Unlike spoons, I make pens using both purchased wood blanks as well as wood from home.

Crafted from beautiful redheart wood sourced from South America, this pen has a simple but functional design for use in the classroom. The gatsby kit is stout and well balanced making it the perfect writing tool.
