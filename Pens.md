# Pens

Pens are created using pen kits bought from various suppliers.  
Unlike spoons, I make pens using both purchased wood blanks as well as wood from home due to the increased importance of the hardness and density of the wood.

### Redheart Gatsby Pen

Crafted from beautiful redheart wood sourced from South America, this pen has a simple but functional design for use in the classroom. The gatsby kit is stout and well balanced making it the perfect writing tool. 



### Bocate Cuban Pen

Turned out of bocate wood which has a increditable grain pattern. Taking my knowledge from the

[redheart gatsby pen](#redheart-gatsby-pen), I put a little more style into this pen while still letting the grain be the main focus. This pen is larger and heavier than the redheart but still has a nice balance in the hand.


### Bolivian Coffeewood Cat Themed Pen

I made this pen for one of my chemistry teachers. She loves cats so I chose this kit combined with the Bolivian Coffeewood. I chose that wood because I thought it looked the most cat-like out of what I had. I think it looks like a tabby.


### Eucalyptus Cuban Pen

I decided to try something different and make the orange hue of eucalyptus core match the copper plating on this pen kit. Eucalyptus wood isn't very hard or dense (which is very important when making pens because the layer of wood is so thin and can easily crack) so I ran into a few problems but in the end it came together. It was well worth it.
