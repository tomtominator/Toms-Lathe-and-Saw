# Pens

Pens are created using pen kits bought from various suppliers.  
Unlike spoons, I make pens using both purchased wood blanks as well as wood from home due to the importance of the hardness and density of the wood. The wood is turned very thin and precisely so blanks must be of the highest quality.

### Redheart Gatsby Pen

Crafted from beautiful redheart wood sourced from South America, this pen has a simple but functional design for use in the classroom. The gatsby kit is stout and well balanced making it the perfect writing tool. 



### Bocate Cuban Pen

Turned out of bocate wood which has a increditable grain pattern. Taking my knowledge from the

[redheart gatsby pen](#redheart-gatsby-pen), I put a little more style into this pen while still letting the grain be the main focus. This pen is larger and heavier than the redheart but still has a nice balance in the hand.


### Bolivian Coffeewood Cat Themed Pen

I made this pen for one of my chemistry teachers. She loves cats so I chose this kit combined with the Bolivian Coffeewood. I chose that wood because I thought it looked the most cat-like out of what I had. I think it looks like a tabby.


### Eucalyptus Cuban Pen

I decided to try something different and make the orange hue of eucalyptus core match the copper plating on this pen kit. Eucalyptus wood isn't very hard or dense (which is very important when making pens because the layer of wood is so thin and can easily crack) so I ran into a few problems but in the end it came together. It was well worth it.

### Bolivian Coffeewood Pen

This is an every-day-carry pen (EDC) for use in the classroom. It is a click pen with a modified ink cartriage for better writing. The wood design is slim to fit well in the hand.

### Bloodwood Slimline Pen

I modeled this pen after the symbol for infinity. I wanted it to be as symmetrical as possibe and I am happy with the results considering I didn't use a jig or calipers to expedite the process. This is the first of many slimlines I plan to make and then sell. Their kit is very inexpensive and quickly made making it ideal for mass production. 

### Wenge Gatsby Pen

The Gatsby pen model is still my favorite for its superior balance and style. Experimenting with a new coating technique using glue instead of wood oil caused this pen to look like it is coating in glass. This is also the first of many pens that will be made with a new set of exotic woods I bought for pen making. Wenge is from Central Africa and is an endangered species.
