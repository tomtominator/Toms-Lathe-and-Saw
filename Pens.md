# Pens

Pens are created using pen kits bought from Rockler Woodworking.  
Unlike spoons, I make pens using both purchased wood blanks as well as wood from home.

### Redheart Gatsby Pen

Crafted from beautiful redheart wood sourced from South America, this pen has a simple but functional design for use in the classroom. The gatsby kit is stout and well balanced making it the perfect writing tool. 



### Bocate Cuban Pen

Turned out of bocate wood which has a increditable grain pattern. Taking my knowledge from the

[redheart gatsby pen](#redheart-gatsby-pen), I put a little more style into this pen while still letting the grain be the main focus. This pen is larger and heavier than the redheart but still has a nice balance in the hand.
