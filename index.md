## Crafted from Local Wood
Dead trees are given new life and beauty through these projects. As projects usually don't require large amounts of wood, most wood is sourced from my backyard, especially wood for spoons.  Here are photos showing various types of trees I use and their respective grain coloring:

### Cyprus

Strangly enough, we have cyprus trees that have purple core wood. Looking online I could find nothing else like this.

### Eucalyptus

Eucalyptus trees tend to crack at the worse times, but if you can control them they have a beautiful orange colored core wood.
