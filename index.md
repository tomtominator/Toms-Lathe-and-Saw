# Materials and Creation  
  
  

## Crafted from Local Wood

Dead trees are given new life and beauty through these projects. As pen/spoon projects don't require large amounts of wood, most wood is sourced from my backyard. Here are photos showing various types of trees I have used and their respective grain coloring:

### Cypress

Strangly enough, we have cypress trees that have purple core wood. Looking online, I could find nothing else like this.

### Eucalyptus

Eucalyptus trees have a beautiful orange colored core wood.

### Pine

Taken from a felled tree in our neighborhood (root beer can for reference).

### Walnut

Here is a walnut tree that was taken by termites. Rotting parts are left to enrich the soil while we carefully pick out small branches elevated from the ground.

## Creation

There is a unique process for creating each type of piece. Even within that process each piece has its own variation since they are all handmade. I have linked them here as well as next to their display photos under each section.
