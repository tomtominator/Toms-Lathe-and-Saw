## Crafted from Raw Wood
Dead trees are given new life and beauty through these projects. As projects 
usually don't require large amounts of wood, most wood is sourced from my backyard.
Here are photos showing various types of trees and their respective grain coloring:

### Cyprus

## High Quality

Turned from a quality piece of pepper wood, this spoon is slightly bent where
the handle meets the scoop. Possible due to the woods inherent hardness, this spoon is
sanded very smooth.

This scrap magnolia piece revealed a beautiful grain. The spoon is bend at the connection
between the scoop and the handle at a sharper angle than the pepper wood spoon. Additionally, this 
spoon has a loop at the end, either to wrap a string through or for ease of storage.
