# Spoon Creation

## Shaping

The wood has been rounded into a the shape of a maraca(although not hollow) and is adequately smooth at this point.

The maraca blank is cut to resemble a spoon more than a maraca.

The scoop of the spoon is carved out using a hook knife.  

Once the scoop is scooped, its time to sand the spoon smooth. I won't include any photos of that because it is almost impossible to see the texture on camera.

## Bending  

The best spoons are bent to give them a more natural feel. Every utensil has a small bend, which makes a bigger difference than you would expect. Spoons that are completely straight feel completely foreign in the hand.

This strange contraption boils water. The steam rises up and heats the fibers in the wood of the spoon.

Once the fibers of the wood are heated and able to move past each other the spoon is bent in a vice. It must be held in this shape until the heated fibers fully dry which usually takes about 1-2 days.

The finished product is permenetly bent. With a little recoil, the shape the spoon was in the vice remains. The more the fibers were originally heated the less recoil occurs.

## Finishing

Spoons are finished by initially sanded down to 200 grit with regular sandpaper, then micro mesh sanders polish the wood to a mirror finish. Snow River Products' Wood Oil is used to lacor and helps to bring out any remaining sawdust giving the spoon a false smoothness. After dry, it is covered in Briwax for protection, a natural feel, and grip.
