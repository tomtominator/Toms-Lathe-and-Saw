|  Furniture projects are much bigger than spoon or pen projects and as a result are fewer and further between. As with spoons and pens, I like to let the grain do the talking in my furniture. Allowing the grain to speak is the art.  |

### Birch Sidetable

This birch sidetable is a lighthearted table meant to greet next to the door. With light woods and a slight shimmer, it welcomes. The top is a combination of birch and a maple centerpiece. The legs are redwood with a birch peg lined for support and connected to a birch core. Interesting in the construction? [Table Construction](SideTableCreation.md)  (12/25/2019)
